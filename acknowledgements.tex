\chapter{Acknowledgements}
\label{ch:acknowledgements}

Who needs thank-yous? Math dep't at Kealing... magnet directors (Hovland, Goka, Ramberg)... a general shout out to all of our students over the years? MTCA folks?

Also: should we try to recruit an editor w/ a mathematics background? Altha and Adriana both come to mind...

Thanks to Shawn Tyson for editing help. The serial comma was always a given, naturally, but who knew that ``logical punctuation'' was a thing?

This book was typeset using \LaTeX, so we want to thank the authors, maintainers, and package designers whose work has made that possible. Thanks also to the online \LaTeX\ community, in particular all those who have posed and answered questions at \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/}{tex.stackexchange.com}.
